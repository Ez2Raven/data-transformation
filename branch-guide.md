# BRANCH GUIDE

Following are the most important branches:

- `dev`: Contains the latest code **and it is the branch actively developed**.<br/>
  Note that **all PRs must be against `dev` branch to be considered**. <br/>
  This branch is developed using .NET Core 5.0
- `main`: Synced time to time from dev. It contains "stable" code, although not the latest one.<br/>
  We plan to do periodic merges from `dev` to `master`, but we are not doing it right now.

Any other branch is considered temporary and could be deleted at any time. Do not do any PR to them!

Good luck and keep on coding!
